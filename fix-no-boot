Following will help with fixing a No Boot to filesystem:  
Issue: Grub2 (Dump to Grub prompt)
Issue: Grub2 (Will not set correct 3rd entry in Menuentry)
Issue: "Gave up waiting for Resume"
Issue: initrams (dump to prompt)

Note:  It is easier to fix these issues if you have a USB Stick with Debian GUI or Ubuntu LTS was installed; not Live System. 
       You can not update-grub from a Live System. 
       If you use a Live DVD or USB Stick you will need to install that live to anoter hard drive partition or USB Stick; and
       Then do the below fixes.
       
       As used below:  "x" is the number of your device "Drive" assigned to our hard drive or USB stick that you want to fix.
       As used below:  "X" is the letter of the partition you want to fix.
       
Needed:  USB Stick that has Debian or Ubuntu Distro installed (not Live DVD or USB)

**issue: Grub2 (Dump to Grub prompt)

  1. Boot Debian or Ubuntu USB Stick
  
  2. Open Terminal and run sudo commands:
  
        sudo grub-install /dev/sdx
        
        sudo update-grub
        
        sudo blkid
        
    (Record uuid= number "without double quotes" for first partition of drive you are tryng to fix (for example /dev/sda1)
        /dev/sda1: UUID="a8ee372d-07d5-4912-a103-503c5ecc063c"
        
  3. Reboot to USB Stick
  
  4. Highlight the first partition on drive you are trying to fix (for example) /dev/sda1 
        press "e" key
        Verify all entries for uuid= are same, If not same, verity your correct uuid= for first partition
        Use arrow keys past uuid= number and use backspace to delete uuid= number
        Manually type in corect uuid= number
        Press F10 to boot with all correct uuid= number for first partition of drive you are trying to fix.
        
  5. Now that you have booted successfully to first partition of drive you are wanting to fix, run this sudo command:
